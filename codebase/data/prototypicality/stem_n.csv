root.n.03,"The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. .",0.8415923521836078
root.n.03,"For example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .",0.8344396947288011
root.n.03,"There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto Yokuts .",0.896638639372566
root.n.03,"The differentiation however is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 .",0.8828596561339036
root.n.03,"( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . )",0.8590243647722334
root.n.03,"If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually .",0.8442876120180813
root.n.03,"For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems .",0.858601355764128
root.n.03,"For Athabascan , with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively * * f ; * * f ; and * * f stems .",0.8868837285183846

root.n.03,"The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement .",0.8025301627048618
root.n.03,"Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency .",0.8602960596148098
root.n.03,"Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % .",0.8898412948605247

root.n.03,But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area .,0.9173458533697172
root.n.03,"I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two Stem Meanings ' , I set off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A 3 , the unasterisked ones standing for * * f ; or under ' Four Stems ' , I set off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f .",0.8738588998953405

root.n.03,"If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ?",0.8917149280900619
root.n.03,"Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller .",0.8149316367398372
