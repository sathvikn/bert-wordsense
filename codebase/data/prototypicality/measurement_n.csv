measurement.n.01,"The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600 ` K .",0.8580538022162152
measurement.n.01,"They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at Full Moon .",0.837138165129028
measurement.n.01,Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth .,0.8981656314848404

measurement.n.01,"The measurements made with the NRL 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized .",0.9094832860944481
measurement.n.01,"Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960 - Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk .",0.8612880557711527
