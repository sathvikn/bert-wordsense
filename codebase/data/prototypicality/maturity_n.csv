adulthood.n.01,"It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect .",0.9339298351012466
adulthood.n.01,"Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions .",0.8996705153581801
adulthood.n.01,"For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage .",0.9126764160242123
adulthood.n.01,"If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .",0.9028264882667298

adulthood.n.01,I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet .,0.755352004705415
adulthood.n.01,"It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation .",0.9073624511057701
adulthood.n.01,Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity .,0.81582162044162
adulthood.n.01,"size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; time required to reach maturity ; rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver 's figures .",0.8716439439787552

adulthood.n.01,I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity .,0.8882273747718562
adulthood.n.01,"From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .",0.8067184976853281
maturity.n.02,The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence .,0.9230528824025854
maturity.n.02,There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls .,0.8702324306605601
maturity.n.02,To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers .,0.9245666894370103

maturity.n.02,"Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions .",0.9181313456980488
maturity.n.02,"The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region .",0.897785798255139
maturity.n.02,The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion .,0.9073984932353754
maturity.n.02,"Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence .",0.9140060072615213
maturity.n.02,The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset .,0.8955788157113865
maturity.n.02,"One growth center in a short bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage .",0.9167540456150025
maturity.n.02,"Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence .",0.9290088747239781
